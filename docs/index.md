Welcome to the [CLIMB-BIG-DATA](https://climb.ac.uk/) documentation!

These docs are designed to help you get the best out of the CLIMB-BIG-DATA infrastructure.

## Getting started

How to access CLIMB-BIG-DATA and find your way around via the **Bryn** web interface.
[Bryn](https://bryn.climb.ac.uk) is the web interface for CLIMB-BIG-DATA, and is the primary way to access the infrastructure.
From Bryn  you can manage your team, its resources, the S3 buckets and your notebooks. **CLIMB Notebooks**, on the other hand,
are Jupyter notebooks fully integrated with CLIMB and its storage, with first-class support to Nextflow pipelines.
